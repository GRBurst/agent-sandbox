# Integration layer. Real confined sessions, in this checkout, on a real
# kernel. This is the only layer where enforcement is observed at all: every
# layer above it reads a resolved policy and takes nono's word for it.
#
# `set -euo pipefail`, `fail` and `REPO_ROOT` come from scripts/validate.sh.

# A live `nono run` from inside this repository needs four conditions, each one
# recorded in research.md against the failure that revealed it. They are
# established here, once, before the first session.
#
#   1. TMPDIR inside the project, or the `system_write_linux` grant on $TMPDIR
#      overlaps the state root and nono refuses to start.
#   2. XDG_STATE_HOME outside the project, writable, and granted by no group.
#   3. The audit ledger exists before the run. This one is load-bearing for
#      the whole layer: the migration that fails runs *after* the child exits
#      and replaces the child's exit status with 1. A child exiting 0 would
#      report 1, and a pre-flight refusing with 77 would report 1, so every
#      exit status asserted below would be the supervisor's cleanup instead.
#   4. /nix/store granted read, or the child cannot exec at all and exits 127.
#      The generated profile carries this as the leak registry's one entry.
# Sets SESSION_ENV to the assignments `env` needs. An array, because the values
# hold paths and splitting a string on whitespace would corrupt them.

# passthrough `nono` earlier on PATH — present, accepting the same arguments,
# enforcing nothing — which is what an unenforceable host looks like from the
# pre-flight's side, and must produce 77 and the primitive.
